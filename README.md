# My README.md

---

The goal of this document is to :

* Approach the Markdown syntax  
* Show the result on a Github repository  

---

## How-To

1. Identify constructs from given result  
2. Write a corresponding Markdown syntax

## Git - a command example

Git can be run through command lines and the current status shown with :

```bash
# Going inside directory 
cd /my/git/dir
# Asking for current status  
git status  
git log --oneline
```
It is also important to note that :

> "It is easy to shoot your foot off with git, but also easy to revert to a previous foot and merge it with your current leg."
